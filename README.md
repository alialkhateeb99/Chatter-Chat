  ### Known Issues
  - There is currently no option for authentication/login and no usernames are displayed dynamically. Future support for this feature will be to allow login 
  to distinguish users from each other
  - The backend server is currently sendings the entire copy of the table in the database everytime the site is refresed. Future support for this to incrementally
  send message by message, or via caching the messages in the client side.
  - Number of active users sometimes lags due to socketio issues when opening new tabs/different browsers. Sometimes this issue is fixed by refreshing the page.
  
  ### Technical Issues
  - Had an issue with some messages not being rendered in the client side. Fixed it by correctly setting a react useState hook alongside a useEffect hook
  which will update the page everytime a new message arrives.
  - Had an issue with how to style useState arrays, i fixed this by mapping all the values using map() function and pass a className/css attribute to appropriately
  style the elements.
  - Had an issue with displaying CSS in general . This was fixed by    running 
  ``` npm install --save-dev css-loader ``` and ``` npm install --save-dev style-loader ``` 
  and  adding 
  ``` loaders: [  { test: /\.css$/, loader: "style-loader!css-loader" }]  ``` to the webpack.config.js
  - Had an issue with not being able to display images. This was fixed by enabling more extensions in the webpack.config.js file by adding
  ```  {
      test: /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)(\?[a-z0-9=.]+)?$/,
      loader: 'url-loader?limit=100000' } ```
